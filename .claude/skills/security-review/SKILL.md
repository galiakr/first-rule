description: Judgment-level security review of the codebase — unsafe rendering/injection patterns, missing security headers, CORS misconfiguration, npm audit findings triaged for actual exploitability, and secrets in either git history (from before secret scanning was added) or the current working tree (code that hasn't reached CI yet). Does not duplicate the gitleaks/npm audit checks already run in CI — trigger when the user asks for a security review, security audit, or to check for vulnerabilities beyond what CI already gates on.

# Security Review Skill

`git/workflows/security.yml` already runs gitleaks and `npm audit` as an
automated CI gate on every push and weekly. Re-running those same two tools
here would be redundant — this skill exists for the review a scanner can't
do: reading code for unsafe patterns, checking configuration a linter
doesn't know to look at, and applying judgment to findings CI already
flagged mechanically but never triaged.

**Scope boundary — read this first:** if a finding is something gitleaks or
`npm audit` already catches and reports clearly, don't re-derive it here.
This skill's value is entirely in the parts CI doesn't cover.

## Steps

### 1. Unsafe rendering and injection patterns

Run a real static analysis tool against a maintained ruleset, not just a
handful of hand-picked greps — the same reasoning as step 5: a few
patterns you thought to write down will always miss more than a
maintained ruleset covers.

```bash
semgrep scan --config p/owasp-top-ten --config p/react --json --output /tmp/semgrep-report.json .
```

If `semgrep` isn't installed, fall back to grepping the specific patterns
below and say explicitly that this is a degraded check, narrower than
what a real ruleset would catch:

```bash
grep -rn "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" src/
grep -rn "\.innerHTML\s*=" src/
grep -rn "\bv-html\b" src/          # Vue
grep -rn "\beval(\|new Function(" src/
grep -rn "__html\s*:" src/          # a function building the unsafe payload, not just the JSX call site consuming it
```

That last pattern exists because a call site and the function that builds
its payload aren't always in the same file — a helper can return
`{ __html: someValue }` with zero sanitization, and grepping only for the
literal string `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` misses it entirely if the JSX
consumer lives elsewhere (or isn't in this codebase at all, e.g. a shared
component library). Recognize the shape, not just the call site.

If there's a backend with database access, also grep for
string-concatenated queries instead of parameterized ones — cheap enough
to run either way, on top of whatever `semgrep`'s SQL-injection rules
catch:

```bash
grep -rn "SELECT.*\+\|query(\`" server/ api/ 2>/dev/null
```

Same triage rule as steps 4 and 5: the tool finds candidates, your job is
to judge each one, not re-list them. For each match, check whether the
value being inserted is user-controlled or comes from a trusted, static
source — flag only the former. A static string passed to
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` isn't a finding, even if the tool flags the
line. If you fell back to the grep because `semgrep` wasn't installed,
say so and recommend the user run the full scan themselves before
trusting the result as clean.

### 2. Auth and authorization boundaries

If the project has API routes or a backend:

- Check that every route handling non-public data has a server-side auth
  check — not just a client-side redirect or a hidden UI element. A
  client-only permission check is not a security boundary; note explicitly
  if you find one being treated as if it were.
- Check for IDOR-shaped bugs: an endpoint that takes an ID (`/api/orders/:id`)
  without confirming the requesting user owns that resource.
- Check state-changing routes (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) for CSRF protection —
  a token, `SameSite=Strict`/`Lax` cookies, or origin/referrer checking.
  A cookie-authenticated route with none of these is a real finding; a
  route authenticated by a bearer token in a header isn't CSRF-exposed the
  same way, since a cross-site form can't set that header — don't flag it
  as if it were.

If the project is client-only (a static SPA with no backend, common for
portfolio projects), say so explicitly and note that no server-side
authorization boundary exists or is needed — don't manufacture findings
that don't apply to the architecture.

### 3. Security headers and CORS

Check hosting config for security headers (CSP, `X-Content-Type-Options`,
`X-Frame-Options` or equivalent) — look in `vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`,
`vite.config.ts`, or hosting-platform-specific config. Absence isn't
automatically a finding for a static portfolio site; note it as
informational unless the app handles sensitive data.

If there's a backend, check CORS configuration for overly permissive
settings — `origin: '*'` combined with `credentials: true` is a real
finding; `origin: '*'` alone on a fully public read-only API is not.

### 4. Triage existing npm audit findings

Run `npm audit --json` and, for each finding CI already flags, check
whether the vulnerable code path is actually reachable:

- Is the vulnerable function/module actually imported and called, or is it
  a transitive dependency of a devDependency that never ships to
  production?
- Is it build-time-only (e.g. a Vite plugin) versus runtime-exposed?

Report this as a triage layer on top of what `npm audit` already says —
"CI flags N vulnerabilities; M are reachable at runtime and worth
prioritizing, N-M are transitive/build-time and lower urgency" — not a
re-listing of the raw audit output.

### 5. Secrets in history, and secrets in code that hasn't reached CI yet

This step covers two different gaps in CI's coverage, not one:

**a. Old history.** `gitleaks` in CI only scans commits going forward from
when it was added — it does not retroactively clean history. Check
whether a secret might already be sitting in an old commit using the same
tool, not a hand-rolled grep — a real secret-detection engine has hundreds
of provider-specific patterns (AWS, Stripe, GitHub tokens, private keys, …)
and entropy checks that a keyword grep can't replicate:

```bash
gitleaks detect --source . --log-opts="--all" --report-format json --report-path /tmp/gitleaks-history.json --exit-code 0
```

**b. Code that hasn't been pushed yet.** CI's gate only runs on push — it
has nothing to say about a hardcoded credential sitting in code you're
reviewing right now, before it's committed or pushed. This isn't
duplicating CI; it's covering the gap in time _before_ CI would ever see
it (reviewing a branch pre-push, or reviewing working-tree changes
directly). Scan the current files regardless of git state:

```bash
gitleaks detect --source . --no-git --report-format json --report-path /tmp/gitleaks-current.json --exit-code 0
```

If `gitleaks` isn't installed, fall back to a coarse grep against both —
git history and the current tree — and say explicitly that this is a
degraded check, not a substitute:

```bash
git log --all -p | grep -iE "api[_-]?key|secret|password|token" | head -50
grep -rnE "://[^/[:space:]:]+:[^/[:space:]@]+@" . 2>/dev/null   # credentials embedded in connection strings
```

Either way, your job here is the same as step 4's: **triage, don't
re-derive.** `gitleaks` already found (or didn't find) the matches —
read its JSON report(s) and, for each hit, check whether it looks like a
real credential (a matching secret _value_, not just a variable named
`api_key` assigned a placeholder like `"your-key-here"`) and whether it's
already rotated/invalid. Report "gitleaks found N matches (M in history,
K in current code); J look like real, still-live credentials worth
rotating now, N-J are placeholders/test fixtures" — not a re-listing of
the raw reports. If you fell back to the grep because `gitleaks` wasn't
installed, say so and recommend the user run
`gitleaks detect --log-opts="--all"` and `gitleaks detect --no-git` (or
`trufflehog`) themselves before trusting the result as clean.

### 6. .env and .gitignore hygiene

Confirm `.gitignore` actually excludes `.env`, and check whether `.env`
(or any file matching common secret-file patterns) was ever committed
before being gitignored:

```bash
git log --all --full-history -- .env
```

### 7. Log the result

Append one row to `metrics/findings-log.md`: date, project,
`security-review`, an outcome (`Clean`, `Found → Fixed`, or
`Found — open`), and one sentence naming the finding count by category
(rendering, auth, headers, audit triage, secrets).

## Output Format

## Security Review

**Note:** this review covers what CI's gitleaks/npm audit gate doesn't —
unsafe patterns, config, and judgment calls, not a re-scan for secrets or
known CVEs. It's a heuristic code review, not a penetration test; for
anything handling payments, health data, or other regulated PII, get a
professional audit before relying on this alone.

### Findings

| #   | Category  | Severity | Location         | Description                                                               | Fix                                                                         |
| --- | --------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Rendering | 🔴 High  | `Comment.tsx:42` | `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` renders user-submitted comment body unsanitized | Sanitize with DOMPurify before rendering, or switch to plain-text rendering |

### npm audit triage

| Package     | CVE severity (per audit) | Reachable at runtime?               | Priority |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| example-pkg | High                     | No — devDependency, build-time only | Low      |

### Summary

| Category                         | Findings |
| -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Rendering/injection              | 0        |
| Auth boundaries                  | 0        |
| Headers/CORS                     | 0        |
| Audit triage (reachable)         | 0        |
| Secrets (history + current tree) | 0        |

**Overall:** [one line — e.g. "1 finding requiring a fix before this handles real user content."]

---

If nothing is found: `No findings beyond what CI's gitleaks/npm audit gate
already covers. This is a heuristic review, not a substitute for a
professional audit if this project ever handles payments or regulated
data.`
